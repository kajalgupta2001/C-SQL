// what is oop?list OOP concepts.
OOPS:-

In order to remove some of the flaws of POP, OOP came into existence.

OOP treats data as critical element in program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.

It ties the data more closely to the function that operates on it.

Object Oriented Programming allows decomposition of program into a number of entities called objects and then builds data 
and function around these objects.

CONCEPSTS:-

Some of the basic concepts of object oriented programming 
are:
1 Objects
2 Classes
3 Data abstraction and encapsulation
4 Polymorphism
5 Inheritance
6 Dynamic Binding
7 constructor
8 pure virtual function
9 abstract class
10 templets
11 friend function
